// Dependency Inversion SOLID Design Principle

// The dependency inversion principle is not really about  injection,
// its simply specifies the best way to form dependencies between different objects.

// 1. High-level modules shouldnt depend on low level modules, they should both depend on abstractions.
// 2. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

Push Vs. Pull Architectures

The push and pull architectures refer to the way that the subject (or publisher) sends updates to its observers (or subscribers) in the observer pattern.

In the push architecture, the subject sends updates to its observers as soon as they occur, regardless of whether the observers are ready or willing to receive them.
The subject is responsible for sending the full set of data needed by the observer to update its state.
This approach is simple to implement, but can lead to unnecessary updates and data transfer if the observer is not interested in certain aspects of the update.

In the pull architecture, the observer is responsible for requesting updates from the subject when it is ready to receive them.
The subject only sends the data that the observer specifically requests. This approach is more flexible, as it allows the observer to control when
and how it receives updates, but it also requires more coordination between the subject and observer to ensure that the observer has the most up-to-date data.

Both push and pull have their own advantages and disadvantages, it depends on the specific use case and requirements of the system which one to choose.

Another way to think of it is as communication between different systems or services.

Push architecture means that a system initiates the communication and sends data to another system without waiting for a request.
This is also known as "publish-subscribe" pattern.

Pull architecture means that a system initiates the communication by requesting data from another system.
This is also known as "request-response" pattern.

In Observer pattern, the subject notifies the observers about the change of its state, this can be done in both push and pull way.
In push architecture, the subject sends the updated information to all the observers as soon as the state changes,
 while in pull architecture, the observer pulls the updated information from the subject when they are ready to receive it.
